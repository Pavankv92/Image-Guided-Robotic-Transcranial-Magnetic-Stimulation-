\section{Conclusion [LK, MH]}

Using our test setup we were able to verify the functionality of an image guided motion compensation system for TMS. 
We achieved a tracking error of below 1 cm for many of the motion tests.
Although we have improved our tracking accuracy a lot during development it is not enough for clinical use by a large margin.
Our current system also performs a lot worse for rotational movement compared to translations, which should be considered for future work.
We would like to compare our system to the error of a handheld coil to see how much improvement can be yielded using a robot.
Further improvements can be made by using a head model as comparison input for the ICP algorithm or using a Neural Network for registration instead of ICP.
