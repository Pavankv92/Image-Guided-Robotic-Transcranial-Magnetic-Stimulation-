In this paper, we present a motion compensating system that tracks the patients head movement using a depth camera and moves a coil attached to an industrial robot accordingly. A setup like this can be used for Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), where it is important to keep the coil in a fixed position relative to the head for a longer time period. We developed a functioning implementation of such a system, which achieves an average accuracy of 0.66 cm for a head moving at typical speed.
